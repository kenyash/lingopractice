# lingopractice
A collage of principles i learned in D335, intro to programming.
Intro to programming at WGU teaches basic programming principles such as control flow, data structures, input and output, and error handling, as well as modular programming. This project is an attempt for me to bring together all the principles learned in the programming course, as well as learn about different python guis and how they interact with programming logic. The final result of this program will be an interactive lingo game.
